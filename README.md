Kiwi-Socal is based off Michael Hartl Ruby on Rails Tutorial. This took me around three months to complete. Durning those three months I went through the material many times and built many versions of the app. I used more gems than the oriental tutorial called for so my version has more features. You have to log in to access the web app.
